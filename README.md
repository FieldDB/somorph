Somali Morphological Analysis
-----------------------------


I am in the process of cleaning up some code for the first public 
release of SoMorph, which will contain a morphological analyzer 
and generator for the Somali language, built on XFST. If anyone is
interested in contributing, get in touch!

The analyzer is already in use at http://qaamuus.so, a free, online 
Somali-English-Somali dictionary, so if you can't wait, take a look there!
